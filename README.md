# Machine-Learning-for-Liver-Disease-diagnosis-and-Prediction
## Overview of the Project
Liver disease is one of the most fatal
diseases around the world and with this
project we are trying to build a prediction
system which uses machine learning to
analyze the dataset fed into it and come up
with the accuracy at which the ML model
will be able to predict if a person will get
liver disease or not. The goal of this project
is to compare such ML models so as to find
the best fit for predicting liver disease based
on some parameterslike accuracy. We will
be comparing five machine learning models
namely random forest, gradient boosting,
Adaboost classifier, random search CV and
grid search CV.
